The broader vision was to collaborate with the Government of India to make carbon tracking mandatory, ensuring companies display accurate and verifiable environmental data ‚Äî a step toward reducing greenwashing and systemic corruption. We were proud to advance to the zonal presentation round, and the experience further deepened our commitment to driving innovation in sustainability and tech.",
